  "question": "I want to buy a cocktail dress from ZARA, but only if returns are hassle-free. Do they accept returns?",
  "answer": "I apologize for the inconvenience. Generally, ZARA does accept returns within 30 days of the purchase date. The items must be in their original condition, with tags attached, and accompanied by a valid receipt. Returns are typically processed through ZARA stores or via online return methods, depending on where the item was purchased. The process is designed to be hassle-free, with refunds given to the original payment method once the return is processed.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date information, especially during sales or specific promotional periods, it's always a good idea to check directly on ZARA's official website or contact their customer service. If you need further assistance, feel free to ask!"
