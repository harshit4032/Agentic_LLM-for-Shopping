# Multi-Agent, Multi-Tooling, Self-Improvement Agent: Features Overview

This system implements a modular, scalable, and self-improving architecture designed to handle complex, multi-step tasks across e-commerce and general web automation. It combines multiple specialized agents, each equipped with domain-specific tools, coordinated by a supervisor agent to provide accurate and reliable results.

---

## 1. Hierarchical Multi-Agent Control

- **Supervisor Agent**  
  The central controller responsible for managing task delegation, tool selection, and coordination across specialized agents. It decides which agent or tool to activate based on the incoming request and oversees the entire reasoning process to maintain task flow and consistency.

---

## 2. Specialized Agents for Task Expertise

Each agent focuses on a specific problem area, ensuring efficient and accurate execution by leveraging dedicated tools.

| Agent Name          | Responsibility                                      |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `search_agent`      | Executes web search queries for real-time results   |
| `wiki_agent`        | Extracts factual data from Wikipedia                |
| `promo_code_agent`  | Retrieves applicable promotional codes              |
| `shipping_agent`    | Calculates shipping costs and delivery feasibility  |
| `calculator_agent`  | Handles mathematical and numerical operations       |
| `scraper_agent`     | Scrapes websites to extract and structure information|
| `datetimeloc_agent` | Retrieves current date, time, and user location     |

---

## 3. Modular Multi-Tooling System

A rich collection of tools enables the agents to interact with external systems, perform computations, and retrieve accurate information.

| Tool Name            | Functionality                         |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `search_tool`        | Performs real-time Google search      |
| `wiki_tool`          | Queries Wikipedia for quick answers   |
| `promo_code_tool`    | Scrapes promo codes from coupon sites |
| `shipping_tool`      | Estimates shipping cost and timelines |
| `calculator_tool`    | Performs basic arithmetic operations  |
| `scraper_tool`       | Extracts content from web pages       |
| `datetimeloc_tool`   | Retrieves date, time, and location    |

---

## 4. Self-Improvement Loop

The system continuously enhances its performance by:
- Capturing and analyzing task feedback.
- Applying automatic retries and corrections for failed tasks.
- Iteratively updating instructions and optimizing agent behavior using historical trajectories and critiques.

---

## 5. Parallelization and Reusability

- Agents are reusable and designed to support multiple task types.
- Allows simultaneous use of different tools when tasks require parallel processing.
- Decomposes complex problems into smaller, specialized sub-tasks distributed across agents.

---

## 6. Explainability and Modularity

- Ensures transparency in agent decision-making and reasoning processes.
- Fully modular, allowing easy addition, removal, or modification of agents and tools without disrupting the system.
- Supports seamless integration of new tools and capabilities to extend task coverage.

---

## 7. Applications

This agent system is highly suitable for:
- Complex product search and recommendation tasks.
- E-commerce automation, including price comparisons, promo code applications, and shipping estimations.
- Aggregating and processing web data through scraping, searching, and calculation.
- Adaptive, multi-step workflows requiring robust error handling and recovery mechanisms.
